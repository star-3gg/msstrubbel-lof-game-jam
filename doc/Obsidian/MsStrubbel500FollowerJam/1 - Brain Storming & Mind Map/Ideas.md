- 

# Environments
- plant roots that always follow the light - something seemingly simple, following simple rules but able to solve surprisingly complex problems  
- octopus - something simple but profoundly intelligent, able to navigate mazes with ease
- hand on the wall - A simple rule that has to be followed if you want to get out
- conditioned conservative society that does not want to change

### Theory of Mind
I want to use the Meyer Briggs personality types to create characters with depth. Entities should behave consistently & realistically in harmony with their structure and motivations.
Events that have a ripple effect, affect entities differently.
The world should feel alive and interconnected. Information flowing through many channels

## Plot Drafts
### Hands on walls
People that want to make it out need to keep their hand on the wall at all times. This universal rule will always get you through. The protagonist grows up with this narrative but something tragic causes him to lose contact with the wall. When he is lost and despairs over having failed a friend cheers him up and he finds the light, a way out.

Moral: Even when it seems like there is only one way to reach your goal and you fail and everything is lost - there might be a better way you couldn't see before. A single-minded focus can make you blind to better solutions
